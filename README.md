# Wine Type Prediction using Deep Learning
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to predict the type of wine (red or white) based on various attributes. It involves importing wine dataset, preprocessing the data, building a neural network model, training the model, and making predictions.

### Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict the type of wine (red or white) based on certain chemical attributes. We'll utilize deep learning techniques implemented in Python using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Keras.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains chemical attributes of both red and white wines. The data is stored in separate CSV files.

### Getting Started
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy keras scikit-learn
```
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

### Usage
1. Import Required Libraries:
   - Import necessary libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy.
2. Read Data:
   - Read the red and white wine datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using Pandas.
3. Preprocess Data:
   - Check for null values.
   - Add a 'type' column to identify the type of wine.
   - Concatenate red and white datasets.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Build Neural Network Model:
   - Initialize a sequential model using Keras.
   - Add input, hidden, and output layers.
   - Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.
5. Train Model:
   - Fit the model to the training data.
6. Make Predictions:
   - Use the trained model to predict wine types for the testing data.
  

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of deep learning techniques to predict the type of wine based on chemical attributes. Further optimization and fine-tuning of the model can be explored to improve accuracy.
